## useful system tables

* system.tables: This table contains information about all the tables in the database, including their names, engine types, and creation time.
* system.columns: This table contains information about the columns in each table, including their names, data types, and default values.
* system.databases: This table contains information about all the databases in the system, including their names, engine types, and creation time.
* system.functions: This table contains information about all the functions available in the system, including their names, parameters, and return types.
* system.parts: This table contains information about the individual shards of each table, including their location, size, and partitioning key.
* system.settings: This table contains information about all the settings available in the system, including their names, data types, and default values.

```
SELECT name, engine FROM system.tables
SELECT name, type FROM system.columns WHERE table_name = 'my_table'
SELECT partition_id, path, size FROM system.parts WHERE table_name = 'my_table' AND partition_id = 1
SELECT value FROM system.settings WHERE name = 'max_threads'
```
